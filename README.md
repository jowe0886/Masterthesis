## An approach to ensure integrity, privacy and confidentiality in an interoperable business network in the construction industry with a permissioned Blockchain

This applicaition provides a modified verision of the test-network (latest version) from the Hyperledger Fabric samples. The goal of the network 
is the proof that data can be operated and stored via private data collections and implicit private data collections in order to achieve integritry, privacy and confidentiaity. Furthermore, a node.js application is provided bases on the work of https://github.com/adhavpavan/BasicNetwork-2.0 which is able to send commands via http req to the Hyperleder network.


To start the network follow the instructions provided by the Readme files in the the test-network and api-2.0 folder.
