## Prerequsits 

Download Binaries and Docker Images

The installation instructions will utilize `scripts/bootstrap.sh` (available in the fabric repository)
script to download all of the requisite Hyperledger Fabric binaries and docker
images, and tag the images with the 'latest' tag. Optionally,
specify a version for fabric, fabric-ca and thirdparty images. If versions
are not passed, the latest available versions will be downloaded.

The script will also clone fabric-samples repository using the version tag that
is aligned with the Fabric version.

You can also download the script and execute locally:

```bash
# Fetch bootstrap.sh from fabric repository using
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric/master/scripts/bootstrap.sh -o ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
# Change file mode to executable
chmod +x ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
# Download binaries and docker images
./scripts/bootstrap.sh [version] [ca version] [thirdparty_version]
```

Please visit the [installation instructions](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
to ensure you have the correct prerequisites installed. Please use the
version of the documentation that matches the version of the software you
intend to use to ensure alignment.

## Running the test network

Every interaction with the Hyperledger network is done by the `./network.sh` script 

1. Start the network using  `./network.sh up createChannel -ca`. This command start a network with fiver orderers, five peers each with an own organization, five certificate authorities and five couch DBs.

2. Deploy the variation domain chaincode  using `./network.sh deployCC`. This command install the chaincode on every peer.

3. Stop the network by using `./network.sh down`. This command delets all containers.

Furthermore it is possible to upgrade the chaincode with the command `././network.sh upgradeCC`. This command upgrades the chaincode and deploys a new version.

You can use the `./network.sh` script to stand up a simple Fabric test network. The test network has two peer organizations with one peer each and a single node raft ordering service. You can also use the `./network.sh` script to create channels and deploy the fabcar chaincode. For more information, see [Using the Fabric test network](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_network.html). The test network is being introduced in Fabric v2.0 as the long term replacement for the `first-network` sample.

Before you can deploy the test network, you need to follow the instructions to [Install the Samples, Binaries and Docker Images](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the Hyperledger Fabric documentation.
